Hey World,

It's good to meet you.  I hope we have a long and healthy relationship. I'm here because I'm trying to make myself better.  I've never heard of a VFX Producer like me trying to learn code.  I've never heard of one who was "conversational" in GitHub or GameEngines.  I'm sure there are quite a few out there, but I've asked around a bit, and so far I'm it.  It doesn't matter if I get better, because I like this stuff. Writing this now, I feel like I'm opening up to a potential friend.  

To the future!

Cheers
